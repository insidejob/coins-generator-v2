## ⚠️ Important Distinction

- **Business Documentation** (`iframe-guide/`) - Written for end users, focuses on "what you see" and practical usage
- **Internal Technical Documentation** (`internal-technical/`) - Written for system understanding, contains implementation details, pattern analysis, and technical troubleshooting

This separation ensures business users aren't overwhelmed with technical details while maintaining comprehensive documentation for development needs.
